1) Titanic Competition
  For this competition I performed data preprocessing techniques and a sequential keras model to predict which passengers would be expected to survive the crash of the titanic
  SCORE: 0.74641

# Kaggle Competition Solutions

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my solutions to various Kaggle competitions! Below, you'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks detailing my approaches, methodologies, and code implementations for tackling different data science challenges hosted on Kaggle.

## Competitions Included:

### Titanic - Machine learning from disaster:

- **Description**: Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
- **My Approach**: Using several data pre-processing techniques and a simple keras sequentail network i was able to build a model that could predict the outcome of passengers onboard the titanc
- **Results**: The basic model had an accuracy of 0.74641.
- **Takeaways**: This was my first kaggle competition entered and soon realised that I would need to expand the machine learning algorithms and data pre-processing techniques that are required to create accurate models

### Steel Plate Defect Prediction:

- **Description**: Predict the probability of various defects on steel plates.
- **My Approach**: I began by experimenting with preprocessing techniques but found minimal improvement in the area under the curve (AUC) score. Techniques such as log transformations for skewed data, scaling, and dropping unimportant columns were tested.
After preprocessing, I employed the XGBoost algorithm due to its effectiveness in handling complex data. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance, resulting in accurate predictions for the competitions.
- **Results**: Current AUC score of 0.89345, 272/1072
- **Takeaways**: This was my first kaggle competition entered and soon realised that I would need to expand the machine learning algorithms and data pre-processing techniques that are required to create accurate models
